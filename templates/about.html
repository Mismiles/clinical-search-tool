	<h5>This site is a clinical search tool initially made for pharmacists to be able to search for resources.</h5><br>

	<h5>The idea is that you are able to first search for an internet resource.</h5><br>
	
    <h5>If you cannot find it, you can look at the master list to see if it is under the specified discipline or category.</h5><br>
	
    <h5>If you can find the resource, but not using your search terms, you can edit the search terms. Just go to “resource list” and click "edit resource" under the resource you want to edit.</h5><br>
	
    <h5>If you cannot find your resource, you can "add a resource" and fill in the appropriate form.</h5>
